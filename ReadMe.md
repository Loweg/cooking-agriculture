# Cooking and Agriculture
Cooking and Agriculture is a lean overhaul of the cooking system, intended to add depth to agricultural and culinary gameplay with minimal bloat.
## Overhauled food spoilage
Food spoilage has been overhauled far beyond the bland "build a freezer" game loop. Freezing no longer perfectly preserves food, maxing out at 20% rot rate. Some foods (specifically milk, eggs, and fruit) react poorly to being frozen, and will eventually turn into ruined food, which is similar to kibble. However, foods that can't be frozen can still be refrigerated safely.
## Plants
### Grass
Grass is now sowable in fields. Great for pastures, but not harvestable.
### Sugarcane
Sugarcane is particular about its growing conditions and takes an extra step to process into sugar, but is filled with energy.
### Wheat
When harvested, you get both wheat and hay. Wheat can be milled into flour or cooked.
### Fruit Trees
Five new fruit trees and four new fruits are added. Temperate apple trees make apples, and are pretty baseline.

Jungle-dwelling Banana trees make bananas and desert-loving date trees make dates. They are cold intolerant but take less work to harvest.

Cold-tolerant cherry trees make cherries, and are especially beautiful.

Swampy mulberry trees make regular berries.
## Resources
### Salt
Salt is mined, made in a salt pan on the ocean, or purchased. This coveted ingredient helps preserve vegetables in the form of pickles.
### Sugar
Sugarcane is first processed by hand or electric mill into syrup. The syrup is then evaporated into sugar in a sugar evaporator in a warm, dry environment. It can also be processed into sugar at a centrifuge.
## Cooking
Preserved versions of foods are each made in a unique way, but they all last much longer than the raw version and can be eaten plain like berries (but without the risk of food poisoning), or cooked into meals.;
Flour, sugar, preserved foods, and bread can't be used in simple meals, but can be an ingredient in more complex meals.
### Pickles
Pickles are made by fermenting salted vegetables (crafted at a stove or campfire) in a barrel. Pickling has a byproduct of vinegar.
### Cheese
The vinegar you get from pickling can be used to curdle milk into cheese at a stove or campfire.
### Jam
Jam is cooked at a stove or campfire from fruit and sugar.
### Smoked Meat
Meat can be smoked in a smoker with wood to extend its shelf-life.
### Wheat Products
Wheat and yeast are now required to make beer in addition to hops, but not as many hops are required, and beer is more nutritious. The brewing process also takes half as long, and wort-making is more time-efficient.

Wheat is also ground into flour at a wind, water, or electric mill, or by hand at a hand mill (sometimes referred to as a quern). Flour is baked by itself into flatbread (great for traveling), or, even better, with yeast to make delightfully fluffy risen bread. Risen bread is particularly delicious, but doesn't last that long and can't be frozen.
### Yeast
Maintaining a yeast culture requires some attention and upkeep, but is well worth the cost.

Yeast can first with an initial investment of feed and time to start the culture. Yeast will slowly reproduce to allow you to harvest for cooking, but requires a constant (small) supply of wheat or flour. It also needs to be kept warm, but not too hot.
### Desserts
Desserts are sweet treats that are made with a filling and a base. The base should be flour, sugar, or (for you cave-dwellers) fungus. The filling can be chocolate, fruit, or animal products.
### Stew
A stew pot can be used to very efficiently turn ingredients into meals, like a neolithic nutrient paste dispenser. Simply add your ingredients, let it simmer, and help yourself!

## Fine print
Some textures are used under the MIT license from RimCuisine2:
* Buildings: Manual mill, Yeast culture
* Resources: Cheese, Pickles, Smoked meat, Apples, Bananas, Cherries, Sugarcane, Salted Vegetable

## TODO
* Distilling!
* Meat maybe should use salt to preserve
* Millstones
* Balance
* Salt pan UI, general second pass
* Bread and cheese thoughts
* Dessert joygiver patch
* Chunk second pass
### Need Textures
* Grinding machine
* Centrifuge
* Jam
* Flour
* Sugar
* Vinegar
* Risen bread
* Flatbread
* Apple tree
* Cherry tree
* Date tree
* Wheat plant
* Really all of the textures could use improvements. Only the meals, salt pan, and stew pot are anywhere near where I want them. Replacing open-source RimCuisine textures is a low priority.

### Issues
* Traders should carry flour and sugar
* Masks don't work in the architect menu because of a vanilla rimworld bug.
* Processors don't display progress properly due to processor framework bug.
* Stew pot mask not working.
