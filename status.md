# State of the Mod
## TODO
* Salt pan
* Stew
* Traders should carry flour and sugar
* Some buildings should not be reinstallable

# Need Textures
* Grinding machine
* Centrifuge
* Jam
* Flour
* Sugar
* Vinegar
* Risen bread
* Flatbread
* Apple tree
* Cherry tree
* Date tree
* Wheat plant
* Really all of the textures could use improvements. Only the meals, salt pan, and stew pot are anywhere near where I want them. Replacing open-source RimCuisine textures is a low priority.

# Issues
* Masks don't work in the architect menu because of a vanilla rimworld bug.
* Processors don't display progress properly due to processor framework bug.
* Stew pot mask not working.
